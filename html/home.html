            <h1 class="head">Robotics</h1>
            <p class="text">Robotics is a branch of engineering that involves the conception, design, manufacture and operation of robots. The objective of the robotics field is to create intelligent machines that can assist humans in a variety of ways.

                Robotics can take on a number of forms. A robot may resemble a human, or it may be in the form of a robotic application, such as robotic process automation (RPA), which simulates how humans engage with software to perform repetitive, rules-based tasks.
                
                While the field of robotics and exploration of the potential uses and functionality of robots have grown substantially in the 20th century, the idea is certainly not a new one </p>
                <h1 class="head">Robotics applications</h1>
                
                <p class="text"> Today, industrial robots, as well as many other types of robots, are used to perform repetitive tasks. They may take the form of a robotic arm, robotic exoskeleton or traditional humanoid robots.

                Industrial robots and robot arms are used by manufacturers and warehouses, such as those owned by Amazon, Devol, Best Buy and more.
                
                To function, a combination of computer programming and algorithms, a remotely controlled manipulator, actuators, control systems -- action, processing and perception -- real-time sensors and an element of automation helps to inform what a robot or robotic system does.

            <h1 class="head">Aritifical Intelligence</h1>
            <p class="text">Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence—perceiving, synthesizing, and inferring information—demonstrated by machines, as opposed to intelligence displayed by non-human animals and humans. Example tasks in which this is done include speech recognition, computer vision, translation between (natural) languages, as well as other mappings of inputs.
                As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect. For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI, having become a routine technology.
            </p>
            <h1 class="head">Applications</h1>
            <p class="text">AI is relevant to any intellectual task. Modern artificial intelligence techniques are pervasive and are too numerous to list here. Frequently, when a technique reaches mainstream use, it is no longer considered artificial intelligence; this phenomenon is described as the AI effect.</p>

            <h1 class="head">Extended reality</h1>
            <p class="text">Extended reality is a catch-all to refer to augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and mixed reality (MR). Sometimes the abbreviation “XR” is used to refer to all of them. The technology is intended to combine or mirror the physical world with a "digital twin world" that is able to interact with each other.

                The fields of virtual reality and augmented reality are rapidly growing and being applied in a wide range of areas such as entertainment, marketing, real estate, training, and remote work.</p>
                <h1 class="head">Multisensory extended reality</h1>
                <p class="text">Multisensory extended reality (XR) integrates the five traditional senses, including sight, hearing, smell, taste and touch. Perception involves signals that go through the nervous system, as vision involves light striking the retina of the eye, the smell is mediated by odor molecules, and hearing involves pressure waves. Sensory cues of multisensory extended reality include visual, auditory, olfactory, haptic, and environmental</p>

            <h1 class="head">Virtual reality</h1>
            <p class="text">Virtual reality (VR) is a simulated experience that employs pose tracking and 3D near-eye displays to give the user an immersive feel of a virtual world. Applications of virtual reality include entertainment (particularly video games), education (such as medical or military training) and business (such as virtual meetings). Other distinct types of VR-style technology include augmented reality and mixed reality, sometimes referred to as extended reality or XR, although definitions are currently changing due to the nascence of the industry</p>
            <h1 class="head">Applications</h1>
            <p class="text">Virtual reality is most commonly used in entertainment applications such as video games, 3D cinema, amusement park rides including dark rides and social virtual worlds. Consumer virtual reality headsets were first released by video game companies in the early-mid 1990s. Beginning in the 2010s, next-generation commercial tethered headsets were released by Oculus (Rift), HTC (Vive) and Sony (PlayStation VR), setting off a new wave of application development. 3D cinema has been used for sporting events, pornography, fine art, music videos and short films. </p>
